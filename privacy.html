    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 6, 2024</p>
    <p>
        This privacy policy applies to the Smart Recorder Notes app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile
        devices that was created by <strong>Son Bui</strong> as a Freemium service. This service is
        intended for use "AS IS".
    </p>

    <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
    <p>
        The Application collects potential personally identifiable information and audio data solely for the purpose of
        providing its core functionality (Recording and Transcription).
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>1. Audio Recordings:</strong> The Application records audio via the microphone only when you explicitly
        start a recording. These audio files are stored locally on your device.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>2. Transcription Data:</strong> The Application uses on-device AI technology (Whisper) to transcribe
        your audio. Your audio recordings are NOT uploaded to any server for transcription; all processing happens
        locally on your phone to ensure privacy.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>3. Third Party Services:</strong> The Application uses third-party services that may collect information
        used to identify you to support advertising and improvement of the app.

    </ul>

    <h3>Log Data</h3>
    <p>
        When you use the Application, in case of an error in the app, we collect data and information (through
        third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device
        Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when
        utilizing the service, the time and date of your use of the service, and other statistics.
    </p>

    <h3>Cookies</h3>
    <p>
        This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code and libraries
        that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or
        refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device.
    </p>

    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>
        We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
        acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of
        electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
