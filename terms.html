    <h2>Terms &amp; Conditions</h2>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 6, 2024</p>
    <p>
        By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
        that you read them carefully before using the app. You're not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the
        app, or our trademarks in any way. You're not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you
        also shouldn't try to translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions. The app itself, and
        all the trade marks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, still

    <h3>1. Use of AI Transcription</h3>
    <p>
        The "Smart Recorder Notes" app uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to transcribe audio. While we strive for high
        accuracy, AI transcription may contain errors or inaccuracies. The transcribed text is provided "as is" and
        should not be relied upon as a completely accurate record of the audio. The developer is not responsible for any
        misunderstandings or damages resulting from errors in transcription.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Premium Subscriptions & Billing</h3>
    <p>
        The app offers a Premium version (via Google Play Billing) which removes advertisements.
    <ul>
        <li>Payments will be charged to your Google Play Account at confirmation of purchase.</li>
        <li>One-time purchases (Lifetime) are valid indefinitely on the account used for purchase.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>3. User Data and Privacy</h3>
    <p>
        All audio recordings and transcriptions are stored locally on your device. The developer does not have access to
        your personal recordings or transcripts. It is your responsibility to back up your data. We are not liable for
        any data loss due to device failure or app uninstallation.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>
        The app uses third-party services (Google AdMob) that declare their own Terms and Conditions.
